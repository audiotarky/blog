We're pleased to be showcasing our platform via [Grant for the Web](https://www.grantfortheweb.org/) at [#MozFest](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/mozfest) - Mozilla's annual gathering for activists in diverse global movements fighting for a more humane digital world. This year’s edition of the Festival began at the start of this week and runs through until Friday 19th March.

To coincide with the Festival, the web monetisation service that we utilise, called [Coil](https://coil.com), who are the lead sponsors of the festival, are giving away free 1-month trials. In case you're not already up to speed, Coil is the web monetisation platform that streams payments directly to artists on [Audiotarky](https://audiotarky.com), every time a Coil user views or streams their tracks. Coil allows fans to not only support the artists on [Audiotarky](https://audiotarky.com), but it also enables fans to support a whole host of other content creators across the web, all within their $5 monthly subscription fee. With a growing list of sites on the Coil network including the popular streaming platform [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/), video sharing platform [Cinnamon](https://cinnamon.video/), and magazines such as [Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/) and [Fader](https://www.thefader.com/) to name a few. Coil gives you a lot of bang for your buck.
