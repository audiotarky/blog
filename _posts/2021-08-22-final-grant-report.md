## Project Update

<!-- Provide a short summary of how your project is going. Feel free to highlight a big win, a struggle you had or generally update us on where you are on your timeline. If this is your final report, provide a summary of how your project went during the funded period. -->

We've launched the site publicly, officially "at" Mozfest which saw a nice bump in traffic. We've also had some local press which got us some interest from artists. We'd had a target of 50 bands/artists on the site by the end of the grant and now have 177 (with 671 tracks between them) - so that's nice! Streamed payments to the site have covered hosting costs for the coming months, which I think is another, slightly smaller, success.

The album the grant funded has [been released](https://www.audiotarky.com/$/artists/anechoics/patterns-of-hope-destruction/). Without any promotion (beyond sending the link to friends) it's made about the same as selling a CD. Again, not setting the world alight, but a decent starting point, and proof that the model works for small independent artists.

## Progress on objectives

<!-- Referencing your original proposal, please update on each objective.
It's OK if some of them have evolved - simply share how and why that happened. If you have links to any outputs, either final or in-progress (e.g. mock ups, prototypes) share them here. This could include blogs, documentation, GitHub repos, tools audio-video content, etc. -->
All the objectives have been met. We've released the site and its been a factor 3 more popular than we'd aimed for, with fairly minimal marketing budget and a very "MVP" UX for artists (sorry for the [google forms](https://blog.audiotarky.com/2020/11/15/tech-stack/index.html)!).

We've open sourced some components, but not had much response to them to date.

## Key activities

I think we've achieved most of what was intended. I'd hoped to be able to provide some numbers around streams & associated payments, but we didn't collect sufficient data to demonstrate anything clearly. I can say of the |approx 2000 streams from mid-May to mid-August, almost half were done with Coil. We also decided [early on][first] to move away from the "scraps" idea in the original submission, and it's interesting to read the experience of the [freesound][] team who ran into similar issues to what made us rethink.

## Communications and marketing

<!-- How have you discussed your work in public? Please include any links to writing, interviews, podcasts, webinars, tutorials etc. If you included marketing in your budget, provide examples of how those funds were spent. -->
I think we underestimated the amount of work here. We need to address the following issues;

- a number of vastly larger and better known incumbents (Spotify, Soundcloud, Bandcamp etc.) - why should an artist spend the time to get an ILP enabled wallet and upload tracks to a new service?
- WebMonetisation/Coil is still new technology - this is limiting both as its an extra hurdle for artists and the number of paying listeners is small (but hopefully growing)
- a lot of FUD around anything/everything crypto (though I think Coil do a good job of making this transparent)

We had a good message, but needed to get that out at a scale and that wasn't what our grant was capable of funding.

## What’s next?

<!-- For Progress reports: What will you do during the remainder of your funded grant period? What is still left to accomplish on your timeline?   For Final reports, let us know where you’ll take your work next? -->
The site essentially pays for itself currently (its hosting fees are modest) so keeping it online and growing organically and improving incrementally is the current plan.

We've applied for a [grant from Ripple][xrpl-grant] to build an NFT market place on top of what is already in place - if we get that we can build more and faster. We're thinking we can do something interesting combining NFTs and WebMonetisation. Off the back of that making some more of the "back office" infrastructure would be required. Today we don't need an artist login, which is a benefit of Web Monetisation, but with the NFT stuff we will. This means building an auth{z,n} system, better track upload experience and being "closer" to the wallet & XRP ledger.

[Rafiki][] from Coil is interesting, too, and hopefully easily adopted. We've added a similar, but less sophisticated, feature to the site to allow for ["direct artist support"][das]. Replacing that with Rafiki would be good.

## What community support would benefit your project?

<!-- Please let readers  know if there are ways we can help problem-solve, advance your work or make connections. -->
Help spread the word! If you hear something you like on Audiotarky.com use the share links to tell your friends (and let them know you're using Coil too)!

## Additional comments

<!-- Is there something that we haven’t asked you would like to share? -->

This has been a great experience, thanks to the organisers & backers, to all the artists that have signed up and listeners who've streamed.
